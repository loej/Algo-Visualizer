# TL;DR
This is my submission repostiory for [AlgoExpert's SWE project contest](https://www.algoexpert.io/swe-project-contests/2020-summer). 
`Build and submit a visualization project for a chance to win $1,000 and software engineering clout!`

# Criteria 
Projects will be judged based on a few criteria, including originality, creativity, technical complexity, and general "coolness." That being said, please donâ€™t try to over-index on a dimension; just focus on building something that you're interested in building.
